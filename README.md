Stalking much? 🤔

Just kidding, what I meant was.. I'm a full stack developer living in London, I love bee.. programming because, erm, because.. it's quite versatile - you gotta see the big picture, understand stakeholders' needs and translate those into requirements, understand how various components interact with each other, and so on. You've got to do all this in quite a structured manner. You get to learn a lot, solve problems, which is often rewarding, and have 8-10 coffees a day.

## 🍻 Experience
I sell myself as a React developer with over **17 years experience** ✨ in commercial front-end development as I honestly enjoy working with the latest web technologies – React/React Native, Node.js/Express, npm/git/webpack, Javascript/TypeScript, HTML5/CSS3, PHP and ASP.NET MVC/C# and have done so for clients such as Lloyds, River Island, French Connection, O2, Oxfam, Lexus and PokerStars. I am always up for new challenges and quite keen on taking responsibilities. Have worked with enterprise user interfaces on e-commerce and corporate websites and have achieved a vast experience in solving challenges. Always have an active and dynamic approach to working and getting tasks done, and I always find suitable solutions, with a high personal standard achieving excellent attention to detail and accuracy. Did I say "Always", or .. and no, I am not exactly a big fan of Always sanitary products 😶.

## 💡 Projects

I am full of ideas and I love working on bits and pieces here and there. I started a few projects, some have failed, others are getting there, the truth is my family is taking a lot of my time and sadly, I find less and less time lately.
