Senior React Engineer & Full Stack Dev Extraordinaire - Brewing Code in London ☕️🇬🇧

Stalking much? 🤔
Kidding!

Hey there, fellow code warriors! I'm Chris, hailing from the bustling streets of London. When I'm not busy being a front-end maestro, you can find me sipping on my 8th coffee of the day (Or is it the 10th? Who's counting, anyway? ☕️😉).

## What I Do:
React/TypeScript Developer: Over 20 years of turning coffee into code. I've been crafting user experiences that even my grandma finds cool. 🧑‍💻👵\
Project Juggler: From Lloyds, River Island, French Connection, O2, Oxfam, Lexus to PokerStars, I've played with some big names, making sure their digital dreams don't turn into nightmares. 🎪🤹\
Agile Aficionado: Rapid prototyping, swift release cycles, and Agile methodology - I'm the human embodiment of Scrum. 🏃‍♂️📈

## My Magic Toolbox:
Languages & Frameworks: React (I speak fluent JSX), TypeScript (type-safety is my middle name), and a sprinkle of Node.js for when I'm feeling backend-ish. 🧙‍♂️🔧\
Tools & Tech: Docker (for when I need to containerise my brilliance), Jenkins (because continuous integration is continuous fun), Jest & RTL (testing is caring, after all). 🛠️🚀\
UI/UX Design: Figma and Sketch are my paintbrushes, and the web is my canvas. 🎨🖌️

## Why You Should Care:
Problem Solver: I find bugs like a hungry anteater. Nothing escapes my eagle-eyed debugging skills. 🐜🔍\
Team Player: I play well with others, but I can solo like a rockstar when needed. 🎸🤘\
Learner & Mentor: Always learning, always teaching - it's the circle of code! 📚👨‍🏫
